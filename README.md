# Overview
This Jupyter-Notebook implements parts of the Goldstein-Fattal method, which allows to estimate an image's Blur Kernel and to unblur it. The implemented parts are the retrieval of the phase of the blur kernel from its power spectral density.

This project was done in Télécom Paris by Hugo Queinnec and Corentin Royer.

# Results
All the code and results are contained in the python notebook. The images and kernels that we used for testing are int the <strong>ImagesNotebook</strong> folder.

# Reference
The Goldstein-Fattal method is a method for debluring images developped by Amit Goldstein and Raanan Fattal in their article <strong>Blur-Kernel Estimation from Spectral Irregularities</strong> in 2012.
Our implementation is based on the article <strong>Estimating an Image’s Blur Kernel Using Natural Image Statistics, and Deblurring it</strong> by Jérémy Anger, Gabriele Facciolo and Mauricio Delbracio.
